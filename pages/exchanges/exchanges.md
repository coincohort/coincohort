Coinbase is heavily focused on simplicity, rendering it a great choice for first-time buyers. Buying bitcoin with Coinbase is quick and simple. 

Their ease-of-use model comes at a cost: they take a **1.49%** fee on bank transfers and a **3.99%** fee on credit/debit card transfers. These fees add up quickly. 

Coinbase has high transaction limits, though your limits will vary based on your account's standing. Limits can be raised following a request.
