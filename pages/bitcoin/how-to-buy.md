Bitcoin is a valuable commodity – no wonder you want to buy some! 

If it's your first time trying to buy Bitcoin, the process may be a bit tricky for you. 

Don't worry, we've got you covered! This Bitcoin buying tutorial was made for first time buyers. We'll walk you through the buying process, step-by-step, with pictures! 

## Step 1: Find an Exchange 

Finding an exchange is the first step in the Bitcoin buying process. There are plenty of exchanges to choose from, including [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/5967ac4be42b2d0260de144b){:target="_blank"}, [Gemini](https://gemini.com/){:target="_blank"}, and [Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/){:target="_blank"}.

[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/5967ac4be42b2d0260de144b){:target="_blank"} is a very beginner friendly US based exchange. They sell cryptocurrency to most countries and all US states. They charge a 1.49% fee on bank transfers and 3.99% fee on credit and debit card purchases.

We'll be using [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/5967ac4be42b2d0260de144b){:target="_blank"} for this tutorial – however, this is not the only exchange out there. 

### Signing up

Creating a [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/5967ac4be42b2d0260de144b){:target="_blank"} account is your first step. 

Click the Sign up button in the top-right hand corner of your screen:

The following form should appear:

Fill out the required fields, and create your account. You should receive an email confirmation message:

Coinbase will send an email to the address you provided previously. Check your mailbox, and verify your email address.

Next, [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/5967ac4be42b2d0260de144b){:target="_blank"} is going to want your personal phone number. Don't worry, they won't give it away or spam you  – rather, the number is used for verification purposes. They'll text you a security code which you are required to enter on screen.

From then on, a new verification code will be messaged to your phone and required before any large transactions occur. 

The next step of the sign up process is ID verification. Coinbase requires its users to be 18+ years of age. Furthermore, a government issued ID is required. This includes your state driver's license. [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/5967ac4be42b2d0260de144b){:target="_blank"} walks you through the process – simply take a picture of your ID using your phone, upload it to [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/5967ac4be42b2d0260de144b){:target="_blank"}, and wait for them to verify your ID.

## Step 2: Add Payment Method

[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/5967ac4be42b2d0260de144b){:target="_blank"} allows payment via Credit Cards, Debit Cards, and Bank Transfers.
