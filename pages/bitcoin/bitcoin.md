# Introduction to Bitcoin - The Blockchain Pioneer

Fact:

Bitcoin is currently the most popular cryptocurrency on the market.

Fact: 

If you bought Bitcoin one year ago, you would have made over a 7x return on your investment.

But what exactly is Bitcoin?

This post will explain everything a Bitcoin beginner needs to know.

## What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a form of digital currency known as a cryptocurrency. It exists entirely in software, and has no physical form.

Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency ever created, and it was built on a few core principles: 

* Decentralization
* Immutability
* Scarcity

## Blockchain Technology & Decentralization

For Bitcoin, the blockchain is a digital ledger that contains the history of all Bitcoin transactions. This ledger is shared with everyone interacting with the blockchain network.

Every computer on the Bitcoin network has a copy of the blockchain downloaded. These computers are called nodes, and they share information among each other. This is the key to many of Bitcoin's principles.

Distributing the blockchain to many computers prevents one central authority from holding all the power, decentralizing the network.

The other massive benefit of the blockchain is immutability. If one hacker attempts to alter the blockchain to credit coins to himself, he may succeed in altering the blockchain on one or a few computers. However, the network will ignore this change, since the majority of computers were not altered.

The principles of decentralization and immutability help keep bitcoin fair for all.

Transactions on the blockchain are not recorded automatically, though. Such a task requires time and energy, which is why Bitcoin implements mining in order to power and verify the blockchain.

## Mining & Proof-of-Work 

Transactions on the blockchain are verified by bitcoin miners, who are in turn rewarded with bitcoin. But what exactly do bitcoin miners do?

Miners verify blocks on the blockchain. A block is a set of transactions that takes up 1 MB of data. The size of each transaction varies greatly and one block may be hundreds or thousands of transactions.

In order to verify blocks, miners must guess the correct cryptographic hash for that block.
