When it comes to storing your cryptocurrency, there are plenty of options available to you. 

If you've expanded your portfolio into the altcoin market, you might be storing some of your tokens on exchanges. This method works, but it is *not recommended!* 

Centralized exchanges have a single point of failure – if you've paid attention to the news in recent years, then you know exchanges are susceptible to cyber attack. 

Unless you want your digital assets to be stolen from you, we suggest purchasing a hardware wallet. **This guide will highlight the 5 best cryptocurrency wallets of 2018.**

## Why Should You Buy a Hardware Wallet? 

*We highly recommend purchasing a hardware wallet to ensure the highest level of security for your crypto portfolio*. 

Hardware wallets provide a host of benefits, including: 

1. Your private keys are never exposed to your computer – you can connect them to a PC that has been infected with malware without worrying about revealing any sensitive information 

2. The wallet requires you to confirm a transaction on your device, rather than your computer. This prevents someone from remotely stealing your tokens. 

3. Hardware wallets are encrypted with a pin number – in most cases, they require a 24 word recovery phrase to gain access to their contents

4. Most companies' software that produce hardware wallets use open source code. This means users can validate the wallet's integrity 

## Software Wallets

Software wallets are a convenient, free alternative to hardware wallets. Although, many people ask the question: *are software wallets safe to use?* 

In short, yes, software wallets such as MyEtherWallet are safe. The developers do not have access to your private keys. Just make sure you keep them secure – if your private key is lost or stolen, then you're really out of luck... 

MyEtherWallet is a popular choice for storing Ethereum and other ERC-20 tokens. For a full list of Myetherwallet's supported tokens, click [here](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/faq/sending-bitcoin-btc-ltc-xmr-to-myetherwallet.html){: target="_blank"}

You don't have to store your tokens on MyEtherWallet's servers, nor do you have to store them on any other servers – instead, the tokens are stored locally on your computer via their wallet client. 

However, if your computer is still connected to the internet, your tokens may be vulnerable to cyber thiefs. If you choose to use MyEtherWallet, or any other software 'web' wallets, we recommend keeping your computer offline.
