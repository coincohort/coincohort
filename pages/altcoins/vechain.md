# How to Buy Vechain – A Beginner's Guide

![Vechain logo](/img/altcoins/vechain/vechain-logo.png){: .img-right .img-small}

A variety of altcoins exist, all with differing purposes and tokens. 

However, they can be difficult to buy or even locate.

Most altcoins can only be bought with other cryptocurrencies, and cannot be directly purchased with fiat currencies.

However, the greater difficulty in buying means that greater profit may be reaped if an obscure altcoin explodes onto the crypto scene.

This guide will explain everything you need to know in order to buy Vechain, a cryptocurrency that intends to revolutionize the supply chain industry.



## Step 1: Purchase Bitcoin or Ethereum

Before buying Vechain, you have to buy Bitcoin or Ethereum first. To learn how to buy Bitcoin, follow our [guide](/bitcoin/how-to-buy/).

## Step 2: Send to an Exchange

After buying Bitcoin, you need to send it to an exchange that trades Vechain. In this guide, we will be using [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=28685192){: target="_blank"}. 

After signing into Binance, look in the upper-right corner, hover over the Funds tab, then select Balances.

Scroll down to Bitcoin, then click deposit.

Copy your Bitcoin deposit address. Be sure to use your own address, and not the one shown in the picture.

Sign into [Coinbase](){: target="_blank"}, then select the accounts tab.

Under your Bitcoin wallet, select the send button.

Paste your Binance wallet address in the recipient box. Enter the amount of Bitcoin in dollars that you would like to send, then click continue.

You will then be prompted to confirm your transaction. You will also be shown the miner fee for your transaction. This fee varies, and does not go to Coinbase, but instead to the miners who verify blocks on Bitcoin's blockchain. If you have 2-factor authentication enabled, you will also be asked to enter your 6-digit verification code.

After you send your Bitcoin, it may take some time to arrive. Don't panic immediately if your Bitcoin has left Coinbase but not arrived at Binance. Depending on the Bitcoin network and websites themselves, transfers may take some time to process.

## Step 3: Buy Vechain 

After your Bitcoin transfers to Binance, then you can purchase your IOTA.

Back on the Balances tab, scroll down to IOTA and click Trade. In the dropdown menu, select IOTA/BTC.

In the middle of the screen, select the Market tab. In this tutorial, we will be buying IOTA with a market order. There are other types of orders, but market orders are the easiest to use.

![Using a market order](/img/altcoins/iota/iotamarket.png){: .img-center}

Enter the amount of IOTA you would like to buy. The price you pay per IOTA will be shown at the top right in dollars and in Bitcoin. After entering the amount you would like to buy, click buy IOTA. Binance will take a .1% fee from your transaction.

After buying, you should be able to view your IOTA in the balances tab.

## Step 4: Securely Store Your IOTA!

Once you buy, your IOTA is stored on the exchange wallet. Although your IOTA has been received, it is not totally secure. Every wallet has a private key, or a sequence of numbers or letters. Each private key is unique to one wallet, and allows access to the contents of that wallet.  

If you have IOTA on an exchange wallet, they will control the private keys. This leaves your tokens more vulnerable to manipulation by others. If the exchange is hacked, the hackers will use your private keys to access your IOTA. Additionally, if an untrustworthy exchange pulls an exit scam, they could walk away with your tokens. While these events may seem unlikely, they have occurred before multiple times.

The best way to store cryptocurrencies is usually a hardware wallet, as they combine security and accessibility. Unfortunately, IOTA has no compatible hardware wallet, and must use a software wallet. Software wallets are programs that are downloaded onto a computer or other device and used to store cryptocurrency.

If you download a software wallet onto a device that remains connected to the internet, it is known as "hot storage". Hot storage may be better than an exchange wallet, but if a hacker gains access to your device, they can access your wallet as well.

Downloading a software wallet onto a device that becomes disconnected from the internet is known as "cold storage". Cold storage is the safer way to use software wallets, as the lack of internet access will prevent hackers from infiltrating your device and your wallet.

The IOTA team has released an official software [wallet](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet/releases){: target="_blank"} that allows you to store your IOTA in hot or cold storage. For more information on cryptocurrency wallets, you can check out our [guide](/wallets) to wallets.
