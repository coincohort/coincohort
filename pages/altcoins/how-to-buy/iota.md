# How to Buy IOTA – A Beginner's Guide

A variety of altcoins exist, all with differing purposes and tokens. 

However, they can be difficult to buy or even locate.

Most altcoins can only be bought with other cryptocurrencies, and cannot be directly purchased with fiat currencies.

However, the greater difficulty in buying means that greater profit may be reaped if an obscure altcoin explodes onto the crypto scene.

This guide will explain everything you need to know in order to buy IOTA, an altcoin based on a new technology called the Tangle.

## IOTA Overview

IOTA is a cryptocurrency based on an entirely new distributed ledger known as the Tangle.

The Tangle is based on a data structure known as Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). This is vastly different from the blockchain that Bitcoin and other altcoins utilize.

In order to complete a transaction on the IOTA network, that transaction must verify two previous transactions. This small Proof-of-Work renders miners irrevelant. It also gives IOTA a number of unique features:

* The more users on the network, the faster transactions are verified, giving IOTA high scalability – this means transactions are nearly instantaneous
* No transaction fees
* More decentralized than any blockchain since it has no miners
* IOTA utilizes a trinary hash function called Curl, which makes it immune to quantum computers

IOTA aims to become the standardized currency of the [Internet of Things](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2014/05/13/simple-explanation-internet-things-that-anyone-can-understand/#391e7dc61d09){: target="_blank"} (IoT).

The Internet of Things is the network of objects connected to the internet that collect and exchange data. These objects include computers, phones, cars, smart thermostats, and even smart cities.

In the future, all these devices may exchange data and money between each other. IOTA's ambition is to become the backbone of transactions for the IoT.

## Step 1: Purchase Bitcoin or Ethereum

Before buying IOTA, you have to buy Bitcoin or Ethereum first. To learn how to buy Bitcoin, follow our [guide](/bitcoin/how-to-buy/).

## Step 2: Send to an Exchange

After buying Bitcoin, you need to send it to an exchange that trades IOTA. In this guide, we will be using [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=28685192){: target="_blank"}. 

After signing into Binance, look in the upper-right corner, hover over the Funds tab, then select Balances.

![The Balances Tab](/img/altcoins/how-to-buy/binancebalance.png){: .img-center}

Scroll down to Bitcoin, then click deposit.

![Depositing Bitcoin](/img/altcoins/how-to-buy/depositbitcoin.png){: .img-center}

Copy your Bitcoin deposit address. Be sure to use your own address, and not the one shown in the picture.

Sign into [Coinbase](){: target="_blank"}, then select the accounts tab.

Under your Bitcoin wallet, select the send button.

![Bitcoin Wallet](/img/altcoins/how-to-buy/coinbasebitcoin.png){: .img-center}

Paste your Binance wallet address in the recipient box. Enter the amount of Bitcoin in dollars that you would like to send, then click continue.

![Sending Bitcoin from Coinbase](/img/altcoins/how-to-buy/coinbasesendbtc.png){: .img-center}

You will then be prompted to confirm your transaction. You will also be shown the miner fee for your transaction. This fee varies, and does not go to Coinbase, but instead to the miners who verify blocks on Bitcoin's blockchain. If you have 2-factor authentication enabled, you will also be asked to enter your 6-digit verification code.

After you send your Bitcoin, it may take some time to arrive. Don't panic immediately if your Bitcoin has left Coinbase but not arrived at Binance. Depending on the Bitcoin network and websites themselves, transfers may take some time to process.

## Step 3: Buy IOTA 

After your Bitcoin transfers to Binance, then you can purchase your IOTA.

Back on the Balances tab, scroll down to IOTA and click Trade. In the dropdown menu, select IOTA/BTC.

In the middle of the screen, select the Market tab. In this tutorial, we will be buying IOTA with a market order. There are other types of orders, but market orders are the easiest to use.

![Using a market order](/img/altcoins/iota/iotamarket.png){: .img-center}

Enter the amount of IOTA you would like to buy. The price you pay per IOTA will be shown at the top right in dollars and in Bitcoin. After entering the amount you would like to buy, click buy IOTA. Binance will take a .1% fee from your transaction.
