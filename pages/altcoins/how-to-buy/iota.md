# How to Buy IOTA – A Beginner's Guide

A variety of altcoins exist, all with differing purposes and tokens. 

However, they can be difficult to buy or even locate.

Most altcoins can only be bought with other cryptocurrencies, and cannot be directly purchased with fiat currencies.

However, the greater difficulty in buying means that greater profit may be reaped if an obscure altcoin explodes onto the crypto scene.

This guide will explain everything you need to know in order to buy IOTA, an altcoin based on a new technology called the Tangle.

## IOTA Overview

IOTA is a cryptocurrency based on an entirely new distributed ledger known as the Tangle.

The Tangle is based on a data structure known as Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). This is vastly different from the blockchain that Bitcoin and other altcoins utilize.

In order to complete a transaction on the IOTA network, that transaction must verify two previous transactions. This small Proof-of-Work renders miners irrevelant. It also gives IOTA a number of unique features:

* The more users on the network, the faster transactions are verified, giving IOTA high scalability – this means transactions are nearly instantaneous
* No transaction fees
* More decentralized than any blockchain since it has no miners
* IOTA utilizes a trinary hash function called Curl, which makes it immune to quantum computers

IOTA aims to become the standardized currency of the [Internet of Things](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2014/05/13/simple-explanation-internet-things-that-anyone-can-understand/#391e7dc61d09){: target="_blank"} (IoT).

The Internet of Things is the network of objects connected to the internet that collect and exchange data. These objects include computers, phones, cars, smart thermostats, and even smart cities.

In the future, all these devices may exchange data and money between each other. IOTA's ambition is to become the backbone of transactions for the IoT.
