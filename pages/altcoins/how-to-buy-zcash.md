Learning how to buy Zcash with credit card, PayPal, or Bitcoin can be confusing. 

That's why we made this guide – *today you'll learn about the best place to buy zcash, and how to do it yourself*. Don't have any experience buying cryptocurrency? Don't worry! This guide is geared towards beginners. 

## Introduction to Zcash 

Contrary to popular belief, most cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, aren't as private as they might seem. The traditional blockchain acts as an open ledger – all transactions are entirely transparent. In Bitcoin's case, wallet balances and addresses are transparent. 

Zcash is a decentralized peer-to-peer token. In fact, it is a fork of Bitcoin. Moreover, comparatively to Bitcoin, Zcash also has 21 million token cap. 

Although, unique from most other projects, Zcash harnesses the power of advanced cryptography to offer complete privacy to its users – many of Zcash's supporters refer to it as digital cash. If anonymity is important to you, Zcash may be a good token to consider. 

Zcash utilizes zk-Snarks or [Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/what-is-zksnarks/){: target="_blank"} to achieve its high level of privacy. 

The token allows you to choose which kind of transaction you'd like to make. You can make a transparent transaction or a private transaction. Simply choose to send Zcash to the recipient's transparent address (t-addr) or shielded address (z-addr). 

**This diagram illustrates how transparent & private transactions take place:**

## How to Buy Zcash with USD

You cannot directly purchase Zcash with USD. In order to buy, you must first purchase another cryptocurrency with USD, then trade it for Zcash.

### Before Buying Zcash: Purchase Bitcoin or Ethereum

Before buying Zcash, you have to buy Bitcoin or Ethereum first. To learn how to buy Bitcoin, follow our [guide](/bitcoin/).

### Step 1: Send to an Exchange

After buying Bitcoin, you need to send it to an exchange that trades Zcash. In this guide, we will be using [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=28685192){: target="_blank"}. 

After signing into Binance, look in the upper-right corner, hover over the Funds tab, then select Balances.

![The Balances Tab](/img/altcoins/how-to-buy/binancebalance.png){: .img-center}

Scroll down to Bitcoin, then click deposit.

![Depositing Bitcoin](/img/altcoins/how-to-buy/depositbitcoin.png){: .img-center}

Copy your Bitcoin deposit address. Be sure to use your own address, and not the one shown in the picture.

![Bitcoin Address](/img/altcoins/how-to-buy/bitcoinaddress.png){: .img-center}

Sign into [Coinbase](){: target="_blank"}, then select the accounts tab.

![Coinbase Accounts](/img/altcoins/how-to-buy/coinbaseaccounts.png){: .img-center}

Under your Bitcoin wallet, select the send button.

![Bitcoin Wallet](/img/altcoins/how-to-buy/coinbasebitcoin.png){: .img-center}

Paste your Binance wallet address in the recipient box. Enter the amount of Bitcoin in dollars that you would like to send, then click continue.

![Sending Bitcoin from Coinbase](/img/altcoins/how-to-buy/coinbasesendbtc.png){: .img-center}

You will then be prompted to confirm your transaction. You will also be shown the miner fee for your transaction. This fee varies, and does not go to Coinbase, but instead to the miners who verify blocks on Bitcoin's blockchain. If you have 2-factor authentication enabled, you will also be asked to enter your 6-digit verification code.

![Confirming your transaction](/img/altcoins/how-to-buy/coinbaseconfirm.png){: .img-center}

After you send your Bitcoin, it may take some time to arrive. Don't panic immediately if your Bitcoin has left Coinbase but not arrived at Binance. Depending on the Bitcoin network and websites themselves, transfers may take some time to process.

### Step 2: Buy Zcash 

After your Bitcoin transfers to Binance, then you can purchase your Zcash.

Back on the Balances tab, scroll down to Zcash and click Trade. In the dropdown menu, select ZEC/BTC.

![Using Bitcoin to buy Zcash](/img/altcoins/Zcash/binanceZcash.png){: .img-center}

In the middle of the screen, select the Market tab. In this tutorial, we will be buying Zcash with a market order. There are other types of orders, but market orders are the easiest to use.

![Using a market order](/img/altcoins/Zcash/Zcashmarket.png){: .img-center}

Enter the amount of Zcash you would like to buy. The price you pay per Zcash will be shown at the top right in dollars and in Bitcoin. After entering the amount you would like to buy, click Buy VEN. Binance will take a .1% fee from your transaction.

![Buying Zcash](/img/altcoins/Zcash/Zcashbuy.png){: .img-center}

After buying, you should be able to view your Zcash in the balances tab.

### Step 3: Safely Store Your Zcash!

Once you buy, your Zcash is stored on the exchange wallet. Although your Zcash has been received, it is not totally secure. Every wallet has a private key, or a sequence of numbers or letters. Each private key is unique to one wallet, and allows access to the contents of that wallet.  

If you have Zcash on an exchange wallet, they will control the private keys. This leaves your tokens more vulnerable to manipulation by others. If the exchange is hacked, the hackers will use your private keys to access your Zcash. 

Additionally, if an untrustworthy exchange pulls an exit scam, they could walk away with your tokens. While these events may seem unlikely, they have occurred before multiple times.

The best way to store cryptocurrencies is usually a hardware wallet, as they combine security and accessibility. Some cryptocurrencies are unable to be stored in hardware wallets, but Zcash is hardware wallet compatible.

![Trezor Hardware Wallet](/img/wallets/trezor.png){: .img-center}

Zcash is an ERC20 token, a type of token based on the Ethereum blockchain. All ERC20 tokens can be stored on hardware wallets, but in order to do so, you must configure your hardware wallet with an ERC20 software wallet. One of the most popular ERC20 software wallets is [MyEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/){: target="_blank"} (MEW).

For more information on cryptocurrency wallets, you can check out our [guide](/wallets).

## Should you Buy Zcash?  

If you've made it this far, you now know how to buy bitcoin, use it to buy Zcash, and safely store your Zcash in a wallet.

Before buying though, you should always do your research to make sure the coin you're purchasing is sound.

Things to look for include how the coin works, use cases, partners, and the team behind the coin.

The sections below are dedicated to giving you the information you need to decide whether Zcash is a coin you'd like to purchase.

### The Team

Zcash is led by CEO Sunny Lu. He served as an IT executive in Fortune 500 companies for more than 13 years and is the former CIO of Louis Vuitton China.

Jay Zhang serves as Zcash CFO, and he has been a senior manager at PwC and Deloitte for more than 14 years. 

The position of COO is held by Kevin Feng, who has more than 12 years of cybersecurity experience.

Jianliang Gu is the Zcash CTO. He holds a master's degree in Cybernetics and has more than 16 years of experience in systems development and management.

In total, the core [team](https://www.Zcash.org/#team){: target="_blank"} consists of 10 members.

![The Zcash Core Team](/img/altcoins/Zcash/team.png){: .img-center}

Zcash is also overseen by [members](https://www.Zcash.org/about#committee){: target="_blank"} of the Board of Steering Committee, the governing body of the Zcash Foundation.

Additionally, Zcash is backed by Draper Dragon, Fenbushi Capital, and Breyer Capital. 

### Community

The Zcash community is large and active, and the team delivers news regularly. The Zcash [blog](https://medium.com/@Zcashofficial){: target="_blank"} posts updates quite often. The Zcash Twitter [page](https://twitter.com/Zcashofficial?lang=en){: target="_blank"} has over 90,000 followers. Zcash's [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Zcash/){: target="_blank"} has more than 46,000 subscribers.

### Use Cases

Zcash has many [valuable applications](https://www.Zcash.org/enterprise#usecases){: target="_blank"} in the supply chain management ecosystem. As previously mentioned, Zcash smart chips can be added to products that must remain cold to ensure they remain unspoiled and fit for consumption. However, this is not the only use of the Zcash blockchain.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/__yfks8BK2A" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In the automotive industry, Zcash has many uses as well. Cars can be fitted with data sensors that create a digital passport of that vehicle. This can track data such as repair history, insurance, and registration.

This data is in the hands of the vehicle owner, but it can easily be shared with insurance companies in the case of an accident or other event. 

Additionally, these digital passports can provide much more transparency to used car buying. A prospective buyer will be able to see the vehicle's repair history and can decide whether or not the condition of the vehicle is fit for them.

One use case where transparency is imperative is the medical and healthcare industry. Implants and other medical devices must be held to strict standards to ensure quality and safety for the patient. The addition of Zcash smart chips will make quality assurance much easier.

Smart chips in implants can also be used to monitor biometrics. If the patient desires, they can share this data with their doctor to receive real time health monitoring.

![Zcash smart chips can monitor biometrics](/img/altcoins/Zcash/Zcash-biometrics.jpg){: .img-center}

Another major area where Zcash excels is luxury goods and fashion. CEO Sunny Lu is was formerly the CIO of Louis Vuitton China, so he has plenty of experience in this department.

Embedding a chip in luxury goods will help to prevent illegal overstock trading. When a customer plans to buy a luxury item, they can pull out their phone and scan the item.

This simple action will reveal whether an item is authentic or counterfeit. The [global counterfeit goods market](http://www.oecd.org/industry/global-trade-in-fake-goods-worth-nearly-half-a-trillion-dollars-a-year.htm){: target="_blank"} is 461 billion dollars, but the use of Zcash could eliminate that problem entirely.

### Partnerships

Zcash already has many major partnerships.

In 2017, they [partnered](https://axiomgroupe.com/index.php/articles/1401-china-s-largest-wine-importer-wants-to-use-blockchain.html){: target="_blank"} with Direct Imported Goods (DIG), China's largest fine wine importer. Zcash placed their smart chips on the top of the bottle. When the bottle is opened, the chip is destroyed, which prevents counterfeiters from filling the bottle with another wine.

The chips can also be used to view the life cycle of the wine, including regulators, distributors, and retailers. 

Zcash has also [partnered with DNV GL](https://www.dnvgl.com/news/dnv-gl-partners-with-blockchain-expert-Zcash-to-increase-transparency-from-the-factory-to-the-consumer-110284){: target="_blank"}. DNV GL is a $20 billion company that specializes in risk management as well as providing services to maritime, oil and gas, and energy companies. This partnership could provide Zcash with a massive list of clients.

Zcash has also joined the PwC [incubator program](https://www.pwccn.com/en/press-room/press-releases/pr-150517.html){: target="_blank"} which will give them access to additional clients. PwC, or PricewaterhouseCoopers is responsible for auditing many of the world's largest companies, including over 80% of the Fortune Global 500. 

The Chinese government selected Zcash to become the blockchain technology [partner](https://cdn.Zcash.com/Zcash_national_government_partnership_guian_release.pdf){: target="_blank"} of the government of Gui'an. Gui'an New Area is a rapidly developing economic zone that has drawn Microsoft, Hyundai, Qualcomm, Alibaba, and others.

![Guiyang, a city in the Gui'an New Area](/img/altcoins/Zcash/Zcash-guian.jpg)

Zcash also has more than a dozen other [partnerships](https://www.Zcash.org/enterprise#who-trust-us){: target="_blank"}.

### Conclusion

Zcash intends to be the blockchain platform for supply chain management. This large and varied field has many sectors, such as agriculture, luxury goods, and automobiles. 

Zcash already has real world usage, and boasts an impressive list of partnerships that only grows by the day. Zcash's biggest obstacle may be other competitors, such as Waltonchain and Modum.

If Zcash can outpace its competitors, and continue to secure partnerships and real world use cases, it has the potential to become ubiquitious within the supply chain management industry.
