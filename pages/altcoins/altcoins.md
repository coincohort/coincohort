The cryptocurrency market is taking off â€“ don't get left behind! 

Buying cryptocurrencies can be confusing, so we decided to make this guide for those who are new to the crypto scene. 

**If you're looking to buy a specific cryptocurrency, try searching for it:** 

<select style="width: 270px" class="select-hero">
          <option value=""></option>
          <option value="/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</option>
          <option value="/altcoins/buy-iota/">Iota</option>
          <option value="/altcoins/buy-neo/">Neo</option>
          <option value="/altcoins/buy-omisego/">Omisego</option>
          <option value="/altcoins/buy-vechain/">Vechain</option>
          <option value="/altcoins/buy-zcash/">Zcash</option>
        </select>

**NOTE:** *We don't have a guide for every cryptocurrency, but we're always creating more! Even if we haven't covered the cryptocurrency you're looking for, the buying process is usually similar. Follow one of our existing guides, and you should be able to figure it out on your own.*
