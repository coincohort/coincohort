# How to Buy Vechain – A Beginner's Guide

![Vechain logo](/img/altcoins/vechain/vechain-logo.png){: .img-right .img-small}

A variety of altcoins exist, all with differing purposes and tokens. 

However, they can be difficult to buy or even locate.

Most altcoins can only be bought with other cryptocurrencies, and cannot be directly purchased with fiat currencies.

However, the greater difficulty in buying means that greater profit may be reaped if an obscure altcoin explodes onto the crypto scene.

**In this guide, you will learn about Vechain, and how to buy and store it.**

## Introduction to Vechain



## How to Buy Vechain with USD

You cannot directly purchase Vechain with USD. In order to buy, you must first purchase another cryptocurrency with USD, then trade it for Vechain.

### Before Buying Vechain: Purchase Bitcoin or Ethereum

Before buying Vechain, you have to buy Bitcoin or Ethereum first. To learn how to buy Bitcoin, follow our [guide](/bitcoin/).

### Step 1: Send to an Exchange

After buying Bitcoin, you need to send it to an exchange that trades Vechain. In this guide, we will be using [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=28685192){: target="_blank"}. 

After signing into Binance, look in the upper-right corner, hover over the Funds tab, then select Balances.

![The Balances Tab](/img/altcoins/how-to-buy/binancebalance.png){: .img-center}

Scroll down to Bitcoin, then click deposit.

Copy your Bitcoin deposit address. Be sure to use your own address, and not the one shown in the picture.

Sign into [Coinbase](){: target="_blank"}, then select the accounts tab.

Under your Bitcoin wallet, select the send button.

![Bitcoin Wallet](/img/altcoins/how-to-buy/coinbasebitcoin.png){: .img-center}

Paste your Binance wallet address in the recipient box. Enter the amount of Bitcoin in dollars that you would like to send, then click continue.

![Sending Bitcoin from Coinbase](/img/altcoins/how-to-buy/coinbasesendbtc.png){: .img-center}

You will then be prompted to confirm your transaction. You will also be shown the miner fee for your transaction. This fee varies, and does not go to Coinbase, but instead to the miners who verify blocks on Bitcoin's blockchain. If you have 2-factor authentication enabled, you will also be asked to enter your 6-digit verification code.

After you send your Bitcoin, it may take some time to arrive. Don't panic immediately if your Bitcoin has left Coinbase but not arrived at Binance. Depending on the Bitcoin network and websites themselves, transfers may take some time to process.

### Step 2: Buy Vechain 

After your Bitcoin transfers to Binance, then you can purchase your Vechain.

Back on the Balances tab, scroll down to Vechain and click Trade. In the dropdown menu, select VEN/BTC.

In the middle of the screen, select the Market tab. In this tutorial, we will be buying Vechain with a market order. There are other types of orders, but market orders are the easiest to use.

![Using a market order](/img/altcoins/vechain/vechainmarket.png){: .img-center}

Enter the amount of Vechain you would like to buy. The price you pay per Vechain will be shown at the top right in dollars and in Bitcoin. After entering the amount you would like to buy, click Buy VEN. Binance will take a .1% fee from your transaction.

After buying, you should be able to view your Vechain in the balances tab.

### Step 3: Safely Store Your Vechain!

Once you buy, your Vechain is stored on the exchange wallet. Although your Vechain has been received, it is not totally secure. Every wallet has a private key, or a sequence of numbers or letters. Each private key is unique to one wallet, and allows access to the contents of that wallet.  

If you have Vechain on an exchange wallet, they will control the private keys. This leaves your tokens more vulnerable to manipulation by others. If the exchange is hacked, the hackers will use your private keys to access your Vechain. Additionally, if an untrustworthy exchange pulls an exit scam, they could walk away with your tokens. While these events may seem unlikely, they have occurred before multiple times.

The best way to store cryptocurrencies is usually a hardware wallet, as they combine security and accessibility. Some cryptocurrencies are unable to be stored in hardware wallets, but Vechain is hardware wallet compatible.

Vechain is an ERC20 token, a type of token based on the Ethereum blockchain. All ERC20 tokens can be stored on hardware wallets, but in order to do so, you must configure your hardware wallet with an ERC20 software wallet. One of the most popular ERC20 software wallets is [MyEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/){: target="_blank"} (MEW).
